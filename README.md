# Rat's Rose Compiler

It is possible the project doesn't ever finish. The primary goal of the project is to create a compiler that can do 1:1 translation from the source code to target machine code, similar to what's being done in some principled fasm assembly projects. The goal is deemed complete when the compiler can compile code equivalent for MenuetOS kernel.

## Getting Started

Run the `scratch.py` in python 2.7 or newer. Check inside.

## Contributing

Use of this project will likely involve contributions. Here's how to do it:

 * Read the `dev/`, consider whether your contribution matches the projects nature.
 * Fork the project in github.
 * Write in the changes, add some project notes and insights into `dev/`, possibly move items into `dev/done/` if you think your work completes some task.
 * Do a pull request in github for `cheery/ratsrose`.

If you pass the quality requirements, that is the code remains in the quality where it was. Then you'll eventually see the changes in the main repository, otherwise I will tell what's wrong and you may or may not fix it.
