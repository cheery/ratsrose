# Name and Repository (and license, and readme)

I decided to give it a name after a locution: "I don't give a rat's rosy rumpus what"... Derived to "Rat's rose", as it describes the severity and attitude of the project very well. This is a project that was abandoned when it was created.

Revised BSD license, for similar reasons as stated above.

The README will contain simple instructions for how to start, and how to contribute.
